# Claude Terminal

A terminal interface for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI in Home Assistant.

## About

This add-on provides a web-based terminal with Claude Code CLI pre-installed, allowing you to access Claude's powerful AI capabilities directly from your Home Assistant dashboard. The terminal provides full access to Claude's code generation, explanation, and problem-solving capabilities.

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store
2. Install the Claude Terminal add-on
3. Start the add-on
4. Click "OPEN WEB UI" to access the terminal
5. On first use, follow the OAuth prompts to log in to your Anthropic account

## Configuration

No configuration is needed! The add-on uses OAuth authentication, so you'll be prompted to log in to your Anthropic account the first time you use it.

Your OAuth credentials are stored in the `/config/claude-config` directory and will persist across add-on updates and restarts, so you won't need to log in again.

## Usage

Claude launches automatically when you open the terminal. You can also start Claude manually with:

```bash
node /usr/local/bin/claude
```

### Common Commands

- `claude -i` - Start an interactive Claude session
- `claude --help` - See all available commands
- `claude "your prompt"` - Ask Claude a single question
- `claude process myfile.py` - Have Claude analyze a file
- `claude --editor` - Start an interactive editor session

The terminal starts directly in your `/config` directory, giving you immediate access to all your Home Assistant configuration files. This makes it easy to get help with your configuration, create automations, and troubleshoot issues.
