## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - If you're having trouble with OAuth login, try clearing your browser cookies
   - Make sure you have a valid Anthropic account with billing enabled

2. **Connection Problems**: 
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the add-on can reach api.anthropic.com

3. **Terminal Connection Issues**:
   - If the terminal disconnects, try refreshing the page
   - Check if the add-on is still running in Home Assistant

## Security Considerations

Claude Terminal is designed with security in mind:

- The add-on runs in an isolated container
- Your code and queries go directly to Anthropic's API
- OAuth authentication ensures secure access to your account

To further enhance security:
- Log out when not actively using the terminal
- Monitor the add-on logs for unusual activity
- Keep your Anthropic account secure with a strong password
